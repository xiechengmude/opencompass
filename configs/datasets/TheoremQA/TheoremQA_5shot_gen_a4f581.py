This result is derived from the properties of the sine function and does not require computational evaluation.\nThe answer is 0.157"),

We want to find if we can have a graph that satisfies these conditions, adhering to Euler's formula.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange Euler's formula to solve for F:  F = E - V + 2\n\nSubstituting the given values: F = 397 - 200 + 2,  F = 199\n\nThis means a graph with 200 vertices and 397 edges would have 199 faces. However, to determine the truth of this possibility, we should check if this graph doesn't violate any other planar graph constraints, particularly regarding the number of edges.\n\nFor a simple, connected planar graph, there's also a relationship between vertices, edges, and faces given by the inequality: $E \\leq 3V - 6$\n\nSubstituting V = 200 gives: $E \\leq 3*200 - 6 = 594$\n\nWith E = 397, the condition $E \\leq 594$ is satisfied, meaning it's theoretically possible in terms of the edge condition for a planar graph.\n\nTherefore, one can draw a simple, connected planar graph with 200 vertices and 397 edges, resulting in 199 faces, without violating the conditions for it to be planar according to both Euler's formula and the constraint on the maximum number of edges.\nThe answer is True"),
